		#autoLOC_8300001 = This is the all new Missions Screen! This is where you can select to play Historical Missions from the early chapters of Kerbal Space Flight. You can also see and play your own Missions and those Community created Missions you have downloaded.
		#autoLOC_8300002 = For each Mission you can see the Mission Briefing. You can also save your Missions during play to return to them at a later time. For each Mission you complete you may see, where applicable, a score to impress your friends with.
		#autoLOC_8300003 = At the bottom of the Missions list there are 3 Tutorial Missions for you to try - each will teach you a different aspect of the Mission Builder!
		#autoLOC_8300010 = Beginner Tutorial
		#autoLOC_8300011 = Welcome to the Mission Builder. This is where you plan out and export your Missions for others to play.
		#autoLOC_8300012 = Once a Node is placed you can tweak and fine tune its settings by altering its properties in the top section of the Action Pane, located on the right side of the screen.
		#autoLOC_8300013 = Before we begin we need to set up the Start Node. This will dictate where the player starts, what the starting settings are for your mission as well as any other Mission Critical Information.
		#autoLOC_8300014 = To start with let's tell the player where they need to start and what their vessel conditions are. There are many options here but lets keep it simple for now and start them at the KSC in their own vessel.
		#autoLOC_8300015 = All new Missions appear with two Nodes by default. The Start Node and a Create Vessel Node. Now click on the Create Vessel Node and notice there is a Name for our vessel called 'Unnamed Vessel'. Click this name now and type a new name for the vessel.
		#autoLOC_8300016 = You will notice there are two radio buttons settings in the Settings Action Pane. One sets this vessel as Player Built and the other set this vessel as Creator Defined. Player built vessels are built by the mission player whereas creator built vessels you as the mission creator must build for the player to use during mission play.
		#autoLOC_8300017 = You will also note the other settings for the Vessel. The Situation is used to set the starting situation for the vessel. This could be at a Launch Site, Landed or in Orbit. The default is Launch Site. Let ' s leave our vessel set to this for now.
		#autoLOC_8300018 = The next setting is the facility that will be used to build the vessel. This can be the VAB or SPH. The default is the VAB. Let's leave our player created vessel set to this for now.
		#autoLOC_8300019 = The last setting we are going to cover here is the Launchsite selection. Here you can choose where the vessel will be Launched from when the situation is set to the Launchsite setting. For now we will leave this set to the LaunchPad which is located at the KSC.
		#autoLOC_8300020 = Please ensure the Vessel is set to Launch from the LaunchPad and the facility is set to the VAB before we can continue.
		#autoLOC_8300021 = Great! Now the player will start their mission at the KSC LaunchPad in a vessel they will build themselves. You can also choose to start players of your missions in Orbit, landed, or a number of other different scenarios.
		#autoLOC_8300022 = Now we need to give the Player something to do - let's get them to orbit the Mun! Go to the Sidebar on the left side of the screen and find the Objective Node that says 'Orbit' and drag it out onto the Canvas near the Start Node - you can find it under the 'Location' category.
		#autoLOC_8300023 = Find the Orbit Node first, locate it and drag it out onto the Canvas.
		#autoLOC_8300024 = Fantastic job! Now we need to set the planet to be orbited and also a target orbit.
		#autoLOC_8300025 = Make sure the planet to Orbit is set to Mun.
		#autoLOC_8300026 = Please select Mun to continue.
		#autoLOC_8300027 = Great! We'll leave the orbital settings at their default for now, but you can see that there are lots of options available to you for setting target orbits. You can even change them visually in the Graphical Action Pane (GAP) underneath the Settings.
		#autoLOC_8300028 = The next thing we need to do is link the Start Node to the Orbit Node. Click the output connector on the Start Node on the right side of the node). Once you have clicked a connector line will appear and follow the mouse pointer. Click on the input connector on the Orbit Node.
		#autoLOC_8300029 = Let's add one final goal to this mission. Let's direct the player to land on the Mun to wrap up the Mission. Drag out a Vessel Landed Objective Node and place it near the Orbit Node.
		#autoLOC_8300030 = Find the Vessel Landed Node first, locate it and drag it out onto the Canvas.
		#autoLOC_8300031 = Now select Mun from the celestial body drop down list in the Node's Settings.
		#autoLOC_8300032 = Try selecting Mun from the drop down list in the settings of the Vessel Landed Objective Node
		#autoLOC_8300033 = By default all Vessel Landed Nodes will choose the whole planet as the target location. You can be more specific though and choose Biomes or actual coordinates for the player to land by changing the location type setting.
		#autoLOC_8300034 = Now link the Orbit Node to the Vessel Landed Node in the same way we linked the Start Node to the Orbit node to wrap up this section of the Mission.
		#autoLOC_8300035 = Lastly let's save our work, otherwise we can't play our mission, or share our creation with the rest of the community. Once saved we can load them up to play or come back here to edit them further.
		#autoLOC_8300036 = Click on the Save button
		#autoLOC_8300037 = Try saving your Mission - click on the highlighted button to continue.
		#autoLOC_8300038 = Ah yes of course, we need to provide a Mission Briefing first!
		#autoLOC_8300039 = Type a Name for your mission in the box at the very top of the dialog and then enter in a line or 2 in the Mission Briefing notes - this will tell players of your mission what to expect, then select OK when you're done. You can also review your objectives, validate your mission and add scoring and awards to it.
		#autoLOC_8300040 = Great! Those are the basics on how to create a Mission. There's still much more to show you so you can now either choose to continue the tutorial (and learn the Action Pane, Events, and more) or Exit back to the Missions Menu.
		#autoLOC_8300041 = Creating Missions is quite simple, all you need to do is drag Nodes out from the Sidebar (on the left) onto the Canvas in the middle of the screen.

		#autoLOC_9990010 = Intermediate Tutorial
		#autoLOC_9990011 = Welcome back! We’ll use this tutorial to build on what we learned in the last one and start introducing some more advanced techniques!
		#autoLOC_9990012 = Let’s make a change and get the Player to land at a specific point on the Mun. Select the Vessel Landed node and select Biome from Location Type drop down list.
		#autoLOC_9990013 = Select Biome from the Location Type drop down list
		#autoLOC_9990014 = We’ll use the Graphical Action Pane at the bottom of the Action Pane to select a Biome. Controls are identical to the Tracking Station. You can zoom in and out with the Mousewheel, select a different Planet with a click of the Left Mouse Button on the arrows on either side of the planet name. You can also tumble around planets by holding down the left mouse button and moving the mouse.
		#autoLOC_9990015 = You will see that as you move your cursor around any applicable Biomes they will be highlighted. Click on any Biome to select it.
		#autoLOC_9990016 = Use the Action Pane to select a Biome on Mun.
		#autoLOC_9990017 = Ok, now we’re going to add an Event to mix things up a bit. Events are situations that change the course of a Mission. Events aren’t exposed to the player in the Mission Briefing until they are activated. Events can be used to surprise a player with an unforeseen and possibly catastrophic development!
		#autoLOC_9990018 = For our Mission we’ll do something simple, but there are all sorts of catastrophic and helpful options open to you as a Mission Creator.
		#autoLOC_9990019 = Find the Science Event Node and put it between the Orbit Mun and the Vessel Landed nodes.
		#autoLOC_9990020 = Try dragging out the “Science Experiment” Event Node from the Resources and Science category
		#autoLOC_9990021 = Let’s link the Event node between the Orbit Node and the Land Node. You’ll need to first delete the existing connecting line and then reconnect the nodes - click on the connecting line to select it then hit the delete key.
		#autoLOC_9990022 = Try linking the Event Node between the Orbit and Land Nodes.
		#autoLOC_9990023 = If you have an Event Node connected to something with other Nodes coming off of it the Event Node path will always take precedence.
		#autoLOC_9990024 = Go into the Settings for the Science Node and tick the Event Node box.
		#autoLOC_9990025 = Tick the Event Node box to continue
		#autoLOC_9990026 = Let’s tell the player we’ve had some anomalous readings from a High Munar orbit and we need them to check it out before they come back home.
		#autoLOC_9990027 = Drag out a Dialogue Message Node and connect it between the Orbit and Science Nodes in the same way we created the Science Node. This will play the message once we have completed the Orbit node. Don’t forget to delete the existing connecting line.
		#autoLOC_9990028 = Try linking the Dialogue message between the Orbit and Science Nodes.
		#autoLOC_9990029 = Click on the dialogue message and in the Settings type “We’ve had some odd readings from high above the Mun. Please increase your orbit and see what the Mystery Goo tells us!
		#autoLOC_9990030 = Write a message to explain to players what is going on.
		#autoLOC_9990031 = Let’s go ahead and set up the Settings for the Event Node.
		#autoLOC_9990032 = Under the Experiment heading in the Science Event Node select Observe Mystery Goo. In Situation choose Flying High and in Planet Body select The Mun. Leave the other settings as their defaults.
		#autoLOC_9990033 = Select Observe Mystery Goo for the experiment. In Situation choose Flying High and in Planet Body select The Mun
		#autoLOC_9990034 = Lets now give the player a choice of what to do next, branching paths are a great way to introduce an element of choice into the players game.
		#autoLOC_9990035 = Let’s tell them that once they’ve observed the Mystery Goo they can either come home or Land on the Mun.
		#autoLOC_9990036 = Place another Dialogue Message Node on the Canvas - put this one after the Science Experiment node and link it to the Vessel Landed Node. Don’t forget to delete the existing connecting line.
		#autoLOC_9990037 = Try linking the Dialogue message between the Science Node and the Vessel Landed Node.
		#autoLOC_9990038 = Nearly there - add in a Message that explains that they can either land on the Mun or choose to come home. We’ll add the missing Node to the Mission in a moment.
		#autoLOC_9990039 = Write a message to explain to players what is going on.
		#autoLOC_9990040 = Great! Now drag out another vessel Landed Node from the Location category and link it to the Dialogue Message Node you’ve just placed.
		#autoLOC_9990041 = Drag out a Vessel Landed Node and link it to the Dialogue Message Node.
		#autoLOC_9990042 = Great! Now select Kerbin from the list of Planets.
		#autoLOC_9990043 = Select Kerbin from the Settings for the node
		#autoLOC_9990044 = One other thing you can do with your Mission is to provide a score for it - this will allow players to gauge how good they are at your Mission compared to other players.
		#autoLOC_9990045 = Let’s set a score which gives the player a bonus if they complete the Science Objective before a set time has passed!
		#autoLOC_9990046 = Drag out a Time Since Node from the Logic Category and position it under the Science Experiment Node
		#autoLOC_9990047 = Drag out a Time Since Node from the Logic Category
		#autoLOC_9990048 = Let’s set the time that they need to do this to 1 day - that should be plenty of time to readjust their Orbit.
		#autoLOC_9990049 = Click the Time Since Node and select Science Experiment from the drop down. Then select Less Than for the Operator and set the time to 1 Day by clicking in the Day box and entering 1.
		#autoLOC_9990050 = Set the Node drop down to Science Experiment, the Operator to Less Than, and the time to 1 Day.
		#autoLOC_9990051 = Fantastic! Now find the Change Score node from the Actions Category and place it near the Time Since Node.
		#autoLOC_9990052 = Drag out an Change Score node from the Actions Category
		#autoLOC_9990053 = Now click on the Change Score node. Type in an amount to give the player in the box next to Bonus Score. This will award the player those points if they manage to complete the Science node in under 1 Day in Game Time.
		#autoLOC_9990054 = Add in the box next to Bonus Score any amount of points to continue.
		#autoLOC_9990055 = The last thing we need to do to finish with the scoring is to link everything up.
		#autoLOC_9990056 = Drag out a link from the Science Node to the Time Since Node. Then drag one from the Time Since Node to the Change Score node. Lastly drag a line from Change Score to the Dialogue Message Node to complete the loop. Don’t forget to delete the existing connecting line.
		#autoLOC_9990057 = Link the Science Node to the Time Since Node, then a link from that to the Change Score node, and finally from the Change Score to the Dialogue Message Node.
		#autoLOC_9990058 = We’ve learnt a lot about how Events can change the course of a mission so let’s leave it there for the moment. There’s one more Tutorial to go which should then give you everything you need to create your own Missions and make a piece of your own history. Don’t forget to save your progress!
