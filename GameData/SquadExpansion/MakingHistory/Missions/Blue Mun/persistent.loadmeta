title = Blue Mun
briefing = Hello team! Itâ€™s Gene Kerman! Your next mission is purely research, along with a little bit of skill. You're <color=#cca211>headed back to the Mun</color> with a cargo of <color=#cca211>mystery goo</color>. This time, the science team asked us to <color=#cca211>release to goo over a specific biome</color>. Once you do that, you'll have a chance to <color=#cca211>show off your piloting skills</color>. Your <color=#cca211>budget and technology</color> have increased for this mission, so <color=#cca211>build a spacecraft worthy of us Kerbals</color>!
